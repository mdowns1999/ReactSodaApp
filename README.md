# Overview

Welcome to my first React app! With this project, I started learning the React Framework. I love it! I tried applying multiple principles I learned as I was teaching myself. I used various hooks like UseState or UseEffect, created a store using useContext, made multiple reusable components, added automated testing, and hooked my website to a backend server I created myself. I also used Prettier to have the code have the same look and feel with formatting. Feel free to watch the demo video, play around with the site, and look at my backend code.

# Development Environment

The IDE I used was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft. I have used this IDE before and found it easy to use. I also installed packages like React Router DOM, React Slider Gallery, Jest, and a package for a star rating system.
